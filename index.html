<center><h1>My Summer - 2020 </h1></center>

<p>The summer of 2020 was the quarantine/Covid summer that changed everyone's plans more than we could have imagined. It is not surprising, considering that the last time something like this happened was in 1918.<br>

<p>Our initial quarantine started in mid March while we were on college visits with my son who is a senior in High School. This is the sunset through the windows of the Air B&B we rented in the Hudson Valley, NY.<br>

<p>I spent most of the summer in quarantine, bored, anxious, and cultivating Covid hair and experimenting with new Covid "looks".</p>
